I saw this picture (http://i.imgur.com/n8gnC2Q.jpg) on reddit
and thought it was interesting that 'fox' was in alphabetical order.

So during a quick break I threw this together to see all the words in English that
had this property.

This then led into a diversion searching for the highest scoring Scrabble word with this property.

This lead to the creation of the ScrabbleScore package on CRAN: http://cran.us.r-project.org/web/packages/ScrabbleScore/index.html

word sources:
word.txt - FreeBSD/Unix word list (235,882 word)

results:
ordered_words.txt - english words > 2 letter long that are in alphabetical order
rev_ordered_words.txt - english words > 2 letter long that are in reverse alphabetical order
scrabble_ordered.txt - same as ordered_words.txt but from the scrabble list, with score in order
scrabble_rev_ordered.txt - same as rev_ordered_words.txt but from the scrabble list, with score in order
